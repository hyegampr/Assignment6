	<div class="history">
	<h2>History:</h2>Established in 1952.
	<br>
	<br>

Magdesian Brothers and California Magdesians were made in the United States for 59 years, starting from 1952.
<br>
	Each pair of California Magdesians® was produced with quality Italian leathers & dense foam for maximum cushioning. We made great shoes that people loved. We were all-inclusive with a wide range of sizes ranging from very narrow sizes to very wide.
<br>
<br>
	California Magdesians® was owned & operated in the USA by second & third generation Magdesians who wanted to continue the business as the previous generations did. Tell us if you want more shoes from us or if you want other items as well.
