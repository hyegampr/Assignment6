	<h2>History:</h2>Established in 1952.
	<br>
	<br>

Our old story/description:
	
	California Magdesians® have been handmade in the beautiful suburbs of Los Angeles, California since 1952 & remain one of the few footwear collections still manufactured in the United States. While most in the footwear industry have completely disappeared, Magdesian shoes stood the test of time for 60 years.
<br>
	Each pair of California Magdesians® was produced with quality Italian leathers & dense foam for maximum cushioning. Our shoes have never sacrificed style for comfort; instead, we strived to achieve both. We believe that every woman is entitled to a well-fitting pair of shoes & cater to the discriminating foot by having offered sizes & widths ranging from 4-14, SS-WW. 
<br>
<br>
	California Magdesians® was owned & operated in the USA by second & third generation Magdesians who share the same passion for footwear our patriarchs held. It's no wonder that our shoes have maintained the motto, "Our pride is in the box." If you haven't tried a pair of our well-crafted shoes, give them a try; you won't be sorry.
